- **Interactive** — hover effects, smooth transitions, scroll reveals  
- **Professional yet personal** — reflects my personality while staying elegant  
- **Easily customizable** — every section modular and reusable

## 🧭 Road to V2 (Full Portfolio SaaS Vision)

The future of **hamza-portfolio** goes beyond a personal website.  
It will evolve into a **fully dynamic SaaS portfolio builder**, where clients can:

- Manage their portfolio content through an admin dashboard  
- Update texts, projects, and media in real time  
- Choose from multiple layout templates  
- Deploy automatically with one click  

This backend and admin interface will be built with **Laravel 11 + Vue/React**.
